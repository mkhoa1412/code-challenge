## Backend Code Challenges Overview

This repository contains comprehensive backend engineering challenges demonstrating algorithmic thinking, API development, and system design capabilities.

### üßÆ Problem 4: Algorithm Implementation

**Three Ways to Sum to N**

- **Challenge**: Implement three different approaches to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to n
- **Implementations**:
  - Mathematical formula O(1) approach
  - Iterative loop O(n) approach
  - Recursive O(n) approach with stack considerations
- **Focus**: Algorithm efficiency, time/space complexity analysis, and performance comparison
- **Tech**: TypeScript with comprehensive testing and benchmarking

### üöÄ Problem 5: RESTful API Development

**Express CRUD Server with Authentication**

- **Challenge**: Build a complete backend service with authentication and resource management
- **Features**:
  - JWT-based authentication system
  - Full CRUD operations for resource management
  - PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
  - TypeScript implementation with type safety
  - Docker containerization support
  - Request validation and error handling
  - Security headers and CORS configuration
- **Tech Stack**: Express.js, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL, JWT, Docker
- **API Endpoints**: Health check, user auth, resource CRUD with filtering

### üèÜ Problem 6: System Design & Architecture

**Scalable Scoreboard API Service**

- **Challenge**: Design a real-time scoreboard system with anti-cheat mechanisms
- **Architecture**:
  - Event-driven design with message queues
  - Real-time WebSocket broadcasting
  - Redis caching for performance optimization
  - Anti-cheat token validation system
  - Rate limiting and security measures
  - Horizontal scaling considerations
- **Components**: Score processing, leaderboard management, WebSocket handlers, security middleware
- **Focus**: System scalability, real-time communication, security, and performance optimization

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
