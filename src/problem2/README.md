## Development

The application is built with modern TypeScript and provides:

### Type Safety Features
- **Strong typing** for all API responses and data structures
- **Interface definitions** for `TokenPrice`, `PriceMap`, and `Token` types
- **Type-safe DOM manipulation** with proper element typing
- **Comprehensive test coverage** with typed mocks and assertions

### Development Features
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Async/await for API calls with proper error typing
- Error boundaries for robust error handling
- Responsive design principles
- Hot module replacement in development
- Strict TypeScript compilation settings

### Type Definitions
```typescript
interface TokenPrice {
  price: string;
  currency: string;
}

interface Token {
  symbol: string;
  price: number;
  hasIcon: boolean;
  iconUrl: string;
}
```
